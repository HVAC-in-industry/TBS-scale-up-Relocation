# Assessment of scale up and relocation of technical building services (TBS) for battery cell production

This folder contains comprehensive static and temporal data about the energy and power demand of TBS,
in particular HVAC systems supplying dry rooms for battery production.
22 locations around the world are considered and 10 size scales are available for each location. In addition, for each size scale
three variants of the internal loads (heat and moisture loads) were calculated. Therefore, 30 simulation variants are available per location.
This leads to a total of 660 simulation cases contained in the data sets.
With the data sets, supply air volume flows of 5500 m<sup>3</sup>/h - 99000 m<sup>3</sup>/h can be considered, which covers plant sizes from laboratory to industrial size scales.
The following world map shows the considered locations and abbreviations used in the data set:

The most important contents of the folder are briefly described below.
`energeticEvaluations.py`: This script is intended to provide a quick introduction to an energetic evaluation based on the available data.
To use the data set, first define the important **boundary parameters** presented in the paper.
Then the script performs a suitable interpolation on the basis of the static data set `automateSimulationStaticResults.csv`.
The content of `automateSimulationStaticResults.csv` is also described further below.
The results of this script can then be used for energetic evaluations of TBS for battery cell production.

`energeticEvaluationsMultiOutputRegression.py`:
The static data set only contains a limited amount of locations, due to the high computational effort that is involved to simulate the complex HVAC model for a complete typical year.
The purpose of this script is to interpolate the energy demands of the HVAC system for locations not included in the static data set.
To achieve this, a multi-in and output regression problem must be solved.
A scikit-learn machine learning model is used for this purpose. A suitable model for regression has already been found using an automated machine learning approach (with the help of TPOT using 100 generations and a population size of 100).
A different location changes the external weather conditions in relation to the model, in this case outdoor temperature and humidity.
The idea now is to take the mean temperature and the mean humidity as input and use the machine learning model on the
static data set `automateSimulationStaticResults.csv` to interpolate the corresponding energy demands of the HVAC system using a regression approach.
The other **boundary parameters** to specify the dry room planning can be set as usual.

`manualAnalysis.py`: This script generates the box-plot shown in the paper for the three load variants considered.
In addition, a line plot based on the temporal energy demand of a simulation case is shown.

### Dynamic data: `automateSimulationDynamicResults.csv`

The data set starts on 01.01. 00:00:00 h of a generic type year and
ends on 31.12. 24:00:00 h at an hourly time step. The data contained in the static data set are also present in the dynamic data set. The data points are identified by the **locationVariant** and the **data point name** (same as in the static data set)
e.g. **OS-2-electricEnergyKwh**. For each simulation case per location, the dynamic data set is then structured as follows:

| timestep (s) | OS-2-ScalingFactorS | OS-2-LoadScalingFactor | OS-2-electricEnergyKwh | OS-2-naturalGasEnergyKwh | ... |
| -----------: | ------------------: | ---------------------: | ---------------------: | -----------------------: | --: |

## Limitations

- A dew point of -60 °C is assumed in the process air in the model. A change in the process air dew point affects
  the dimensioning of the sorption wheel and thus also has an influence on the energy demand of the regeneration heater.
  For dew points well beyond -60 °C in the process air, the data could potentially be less accurate.
- A constant total pressure increase of 1800 Pa and efficiency of 70 % of the fans is assumed.
  If the design of the HVAC system changes drastically compared to the Battery LabFactory (BLB) case study presented in the paper,
  this might lead to a change in the total pressure, as well as a change of pressure loss in the system that needs to compensated by the fans,
  resulting in deviations of the energy demands of the fans calculated in the data set.
- Due to the controls of the cooling and heating coils, which have been developed in detail for the case of the BLB,
  deviations of the calculated energy demands of the cooling and heating coils in comparison to the real operation can occur
  in climatically very different regions. As a result, the calculated energy demands of the cooling and heating coils
  can deviate from real operation in climatically very different regions.
- A five-day week with continuous production is assumed. There is no production at the weekend and the system
  and the system switches to economy mode with reduced volume flow and a reduced dew point temperature during weekends.
  If production also takes place at weekends the aggregated energy values of the system may deviate.
  For a more precise calculation, the available dynamic power requirements of the main components of the system in the
  `automateSimulationDynamicResults.csv` data set can be used.
